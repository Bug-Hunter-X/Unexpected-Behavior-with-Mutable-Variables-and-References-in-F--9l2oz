This example demonstrates a common issue in F# related to mutable variables and references.  The code creates a mutable variable `x` and a reference `y` to it.  If `x` is modified *after* `y` is created, using `!y` will not reflect the updated value of `x` in all cases. This can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to track down. The solution file demonstrates how to address this issue effectively.
